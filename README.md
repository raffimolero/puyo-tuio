puyo puyo but in a tui

refresh rate is horrible, probably only works well on windows and good terminal emulators because keyup events are actually recognized on those

keybinds:
- **Q to quit (important, ctrl+C isn't programmed to work)**
- S for rotate counterclockwise
- F for rotate clockwise
- J/L for move left/right (holding does not repeat)
- hold K for soft drop (actually just speeds up the tickrate in general)
